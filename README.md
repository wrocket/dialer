## What is this?
While poking around through some old hard disks I found this little utility I wrote in the 2000s. It controls the dial-up modem I used at the time.

## How does it work?
The modem worked like a typical home router, in that it connected to your computer using ethernet and did NAT. You'd visit its web interface and click buttons to dial-out or hang up.

Being a budding programmer, I decided to replicate those calls with a little program, so I needn't use the web interface.

## Why C?
At the time I really only knew how to program in C, which is why it's written in C. The code is as I wrote it originally, whatever bugs and security flaws it had.

## Why did you post this?
This project is a reminder of a very fun and exciting era of my computing life.
